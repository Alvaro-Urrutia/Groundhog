        <h3>Welcome to the Groundhog Project</h3>
        <p>		Groundhog is a SketchUp extension that intends to simplify the creation of Radiance models for simulation
		and rendering. Its development started during my M.Sc. thesis, which was 
		focused on performing integrated lighting and thermal simulations of spaces with complex fenestration 
		systems using Radiance and EnergyPlus. Since the thesis was focused in complex fenestration systems and
		shading devices, a few special features were needed. Accordingly, Groundhog is focused on Three and Five
		phase methods, although it also allows exporting models for rendering. It lets you use your own material 
		library, and if the material assigned is not in a library, it assignes a Plastic material with the corresponding
		color.</p>
        
        
        <p>This is an OpenSource project that allow people to modify the Code as well as the documentation,
        hoping to obtain more and better resources for everyone.</p>
