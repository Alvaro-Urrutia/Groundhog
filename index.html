<p>Groundhog is an Free and OpenSource plugin for creating Radiance Models within SketchUp. You are welcome to report bugs, add features, ask for new features, help us create documentation, provide a logo, etc.</p>

<p>An official version is still not released, but you are free to download the HEAD version, which has proven to be stable for us.</p>

<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h3>

<p>SketchUp allows installing extensions from the "preferences" --&gt; "extensions"--&gt; "Install extension" menu within SketchUp. The extensions come in an RBZ file, which is provided with all the versions of Groundhog. Instructions for doing this are all over the internet.
You may have got Groundhog with the complete source code which includes an RBZ file, or only the RBZ file. Either case, you have to go to SketchUp and install the extension as usual.</p>

<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>Groundhog developers think that the way a model is created in SketchUp makes sense in a deeper maner than only providing colors and shapes. That is, layers are separated for a reason, and components are created with a purpose. In addition to that, Groundhog also allows creating surfaces that are not meant to be confused with "normal surfaces". Specifically, Groundhog recognizes Windows as special surfaces (this is useful for doing daylighting analysis), as well as workplanes (which are exported as grids), illums and we are planning to introduce "solved workplanes" which are intended to show results.
Accordingly, Groundhog allows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exporting complex polygons, not only triangles. This helps reducing the simulation time.</li>
<li>Easily working with thickness of walls.</li>
<li>Labeling surfaces as Windows, Workplanes and Illums.</li>
<li>Grouping windows.</li>
<li>Exporting Groups and Components as separate files that will be "xformed" in a main file.</li>
<li>Exportation is done by layer.</li>
<li>Exporting a "rif" file for easy rendering.</li>
<li>Storing Scenes (views) that will also be exported.</li>
</ul>
