<h1 id="label-THIS+SECTION+IS+NOT+UP+TO+DATE.">THIS SECTION IS NOT UP TO DATE.</h1>

<p>After exporting a model and performing a simulation or calculation, it is
often
very important to see the results you generated (i.e. Daylight
factor, illuminance,
or other) within the model, so you and people who are
going to see your analysis
can visualize the spacial lighting distribution.
This can lead to diagnostics
and enhancement of the design.</p>

<h2 id="label-Import+results">Import results</h2>

<h3 id="label-Step+1%3A+Include+workplanes+in+the+model">Step 1: Include workplanes in the model</h3>

<p>See that specific tutorial. It is easy.</p>

<h4 id="label-Figure+1%3A+First+step+-+Include+Workplanes+in+the+model">Figure 1: First step - Include Workplanes in the model</h4>

<h3 id="label-Step+2%3A+Export+the+model+and+perform+some+calculations">Step 2: Export the model and perform some calculations</h3>

<p>The file that contains the results needs to be a single-column list of
values.
The first line may be the name of a file (full path) that describe
the shape of
each result pixel (when imported, each value will be
represented by a triangle
with a color). There must be one triangle for
each pixel. In case that there is
no file, a file with the same name will
be looked for in the ../Workplanes
directory, but with the extension .pxl.
That is, if we intend to import a file
that is called
&#39;MyResults.pts&#39;, it either needs to have the full path to
its
corresponding pixel file on the first line, or the latter needs to be
located
in the relative &#39;../Workplanes/MyResults.pxl&#39;.</p>

<p>All kind of results may be obtained with RTRACE and RCONTRIB programs, and
the format may be arranged by using RCALC.</p>

<p>An example, getting the Lux of a certain scene:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">rtrace -h -oov [options] octree &lt; Workplanes/Grid.pts | rcalc -e &#39;$1=179*(0.265*$4+0.67*$5+0.065*$6)&#39; &gt; Results.txt</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Step+3%3A+Import+results">Step 3: Import results</h3>

<p>Go to the menu Plugins (Extensions)–&gt; Groundhog –&gt; Import Results,
and look for the file you want to import.</p>

<h3 id="label-Step+4%3A+Analyse+results">Step 4: Analyse results</h3>

<p>Groundhog allows importing results from multiple workplanes in the same
model, so an entire space can be analyzed easily. However,
the only way of
comparing results from different workplanes is to have one single scale for
the entire model.</p>

<p>Accordingly, every time a set of results is imported, the scale is reset in
order to cover from
the minimum result value to the maximum. That means
that when you import a second workplane, the colors
of the first one will
probably change.</p>

<h4 id="label-Figure+2%3A+Fourth+step+-+See+the+results">Figure 2: Fourth step - See the results</h4>

<p>However, in some cases, it might be useful to choose your own scale.
This
can be done by going to Plugins –&gt; Groundhog –&gt; Results –&gt; Scale
handler.</p>
