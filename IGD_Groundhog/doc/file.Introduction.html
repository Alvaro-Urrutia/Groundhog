<h1 id="label-What+is+Groundhog%3F">What is Groundhog?</h1>

<p>Groundhog is a SketchUp extension that intends to simplify the creation of
geometry, workplanes,
views and simulations made in Radiance. Its
development started during Germán Molina´s M.Sc. thesis (Molina, 2014),
under
the advice of Sergio Vera Ph.D and Waldo Bustamante Ph.D. The tesis
was focused on performing integrated lighting and
thermal simulations of
spaces with complex fenestration systems using <a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org">Radiance</a>
and <a
href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/">EnergyPlus</a>.
When starting that thesis, and when trying
to learn Radiance, we found it
hard to create geometry, add workplanes and assign materials, especially
for big scenes. Also,
since our intention was to perform these simulations
for spaces with Complex Fenestration Systems (CFS), we wanted a
“geometry
generator” that could not only export all polygons, but also know
what polygon was a window, which one was an “illum” and which
one was a
workplane, and export them in a distribution that was comfortable to work
with later. Accordingly, Groundhog is focused
on exporting models for
implementing methods such as the Daylight Coefficients, the <a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf">Three-phase</a>

and the <a
href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf">Five-phase</a>

methods.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Groundhog intends to use SketchUp capabilities as much
as possible, like its material libraries, scenes (saved views),
geolocation, time and date, layers, solar position. Accordingly,
“workplanes” and “illums” are just another surface that is labeled, so the
user can move them, create them, name them and delete them easily.</p>

<h2 id="label-Origin+of+the+name">Origin of the name</h2>

<p>Even though there are many words that are related to this plugin (sun,
solar, shading, windows, simulation, energy, names of people, sun in
different languages, etc.), Groundhog was named after the “Groundhog Day”
tradition.
The Groundhog Day tradition has nothing to do with my country,
Chile, but I heard about it during an internship in Canada, and I found it
to be an interesting name.</p>
