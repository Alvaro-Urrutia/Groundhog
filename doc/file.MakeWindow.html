<h1 id="label-Making+windows+in+Groundhog">Making windows in Groundhog</h1>

<p>The whole idea here is to make a window that Groundhog actually identifies
as a window. This, as explained in
the <a
href="http://file.GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> section, will be
important when exporting the model to Radiance.</p>

<p>There are two ways of creating windows:</p>

<h2 id="label-Using+the+Right+Click+-%3E+%22make+window%22+method">Using the Right Click -&gt; “make window” method</h2>

<p>The make window tool is in the Groundhog Toolbar (for now, we do not have
icons there,
but if you put your mouse over them, a message with what they
do will appear). It allows making a window through
a thick wall. This is a
characteristic that we wanted to add to Groundhog from the beginning.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that this tool creates a window on the exterior
side (which you can move to the
interior, if you want) and an illum surface
on the inside (shown in semi-transparent green). If you do not want the
illum
surface to exist, you can delete it. <em>All windows have to be drawn
from the exterior side of the wall.</em>
On the other hand, this tool can
be used for generating multiple windows at once, by selecting
multiple
polygons at once.</p>

<p>So, using it is very simple, you just have to:</p>

<h3 id="label-Step+1%3A+Draw+a+wall+that+have+some+thickness">Step 1: Draw a wall that have some thickness</h3>

<p>&lt;figure align=“center”&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;MakeWindow/fig1.png&quot;
alt=&quot;Draw a wall&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1: First step -
Draw a thick wall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<h3 id="label-Step+2%3A+Draw+a+shape+that+will+represents+the+window">Step 2: Draw a shape that will represents the window</h3>

<p>This shape has to point outside (i.e. front of the surface pointing out of
the wall,
as shown in Figure 2). In case is not like that, you can
right-click on it, and reverse it.</p>

<p>&lt;figure align=“center”&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;MakeWindow/fig2.png&quot;
alt=&quot;Draw the window&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: Second step
- Draw a face that will represents the
window&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<h3 id="label-Step+3%3A+Select+the+face+or+multiple+faces+%28it+does+not+matter+if+you+select+a+line%29">Step 3: Select the face or multiple faces (it does not matter if you select a line)</h3>

<p>&lt;figure align=“center”&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;MakeWindow/fig3.png&quot;
alt=&quot;Select the polygon&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: Third
step - Select shape that will represents the
window&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<h3 id="label-Step+4%3A+Right+click+on+one+of+the+selected+faces%2C+and+click+%E2%80%9Cmake+window%E2%80%9D">Step 4: Right click on one of the selected faces, and click “make window”</h3>

<p>&lt;figure align=“center”&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;MakeWindow/fig4.png&quot;
alt=&quot;Select the polygon&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 4: Fourth
step - Press the &quot;make window&quot; button on the
Toolbar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<h3 id="label-Notes">Notes</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Windows are created a little bit inside the wall. This allows moving them,
and you will not be forced to put the windows on the outer side of the
facade.
*This tool will try to mercilessly go though the wall. Take care of
windows too close
to wall borders, they can cause trouble.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Labeling+an+existing+surface+as+a+window">Labeling an existing surface as a window</h2>

<p>This might be useful for many situations. For example, designing a
greenhouse, a curtain wall,
or some other structure with extremely thin
walls.</p>

<p>In this case we can select the surface (or multiple surfaces) and
right-click on it. Then, we must
choose &quot;Transform into Window&quot;.
After doing that the color will change to a semi-transparent blue, but
remember you
can assign different materials to it. You should take care of
the normal of the surface you transform. This affects
the Three and Five
phase method implementations.</p>

<p>This way of creating windows does not generate any illum
surfaces.
&lt;figure align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img
src=&quot;MakeWindow/fig5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Transform into
window&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 5: Transform a surface into a
window.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<h2 id="label-Window+groups">Window groups</h2>

<p>When performing annual daylighting simulations, it might be very useful and
efficient to
group windows and treat them as if they were only one. This is
a feature that was planned from the beginning
of Groundhog development and
is now a reality.</p>

<p>This can be easily done by right-clicking two or more selected windows.
Groundhog will ask
for a name for the group (i.e. &#39;Kitchen south-facing
windows&#39; or &#39;First floor east windows&#39;), which will be
lately
used for naming the files when exporting in &quot;Groundhog
distribution&quot;. Windows without groups will be exported
in files using
their names (assigned by right-click --&gt; assign name). It a window does
not have a group or a name,
it will be exported by assigning a generic
name. This is not recommended, since it is difficult to recognize
different
windows by the content of the .rad file.</p>

<p>There is a button in the Groundhog Toolbar that allows seeing the groups.
This button assigns
random colors to each group, and is deactivated like
any other tool (i.e. by pressing the space-bar). When
deactivated,
everything goes back to normal and the previous materials are
assigned.</p>
