<h1>Understanding Groundhog</h1>
<p align="justify">The following sections reference some <a href="http://www.radiance-online.org/">Radiance</a> 
programs and conceptual elements. It is assumed that you have some (not really advanced) knowledge about those topics.</p>

<p align="justify">Groundhog intends to use as much as possible the main SketchUp features. 
This allows using other SketchUp geometry-generating-plugins and still be able to export to 
Radiance. You can even download models from the 3D Warehouse (some complex models will include "non planar" faces... 
in my experience, I just erase them, and the model is usually not affected).</p>

<p align="justify">Internally, Groundhog only analyzes SketchUp surfaces (<a href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/face.php">faces</a>), 
and only exports Radiance polygons (which will not only be triangles, but more complex 
polygons as well). For now, Groundhog only exports in one distribution (i.e. set of files and folders) 
making a difference between Windows, Workplanes, Illums and normal surfaces. This distribution
is the one I use, and keeping it constant helps creating scripts for Daylight analysis.</p>

<p align="justify">The following section explains what are and how Groundhog identifies different kinds of 
surfaces in the scene, and how the two different exporting options deal with such components.</p>

<h2>Different kinds of surfaces: Labels</h2>
<p align="justify">As was explained earlier, Groundhog will only export SketchUp's <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/face.php">faces</a>. 
Such faces may be of four different classes: illum, window, workplane and "the rest".  
In order to be light, fast and easy to use, Groundhog "Labels" the different polygons in the 
scene by using SketchUp's <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/entity.php#set_attribute">
set_attribute</a> and <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/entity.php#get_attribute">
get_attribute</a> API methods. This allows the used to delete, move, create and split workplanes, illums and windows with the tools provided by SketchUp. 
For example, if a workplane has been define within the model, dividing it (by drawing a line within it) or copying and pasting it
will result in the existence of two workplanes. In the same way, deleting it will make the workplane desapear without the need
of going through complex internal data structures.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p align="justify">Even though it is not necessary to identify windows as "special elements" when we want 
to make a render, there are some other cases where it is very convenient to export them separately. In order 
to achieve this identification, Groundhog can internally tell (from its Label) if a surface is a window or not, 
and export it separatly.</p>

<h3>Workplanes</h3>
<p align="justify">Workplanes are planes of the space where we would like to measure the illuminance or luminance 
levels. Even though in a Groundhog-created SketchUp model the workplanes will be represented as a (semi-transparent red)
 surface, it will be exported as a sensor grid in a file that represent such sensors in a format that can be used with 
 Radiance's  <a href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rcontrib.pdf">rcontrib</a> 
 and <a href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rtrace.pdf">rtrace</a> programs.</p>
 
<h3>Illum surfaces</h3>

<p align="justify">On an e-mail conversation, Greg Ward helped me define illum surfaces as:</p>

<blockquote align="justify"><i>Illum surfaces, also known as "impostors" or "proxies," are light-emitting surfaces whose luminous 
distributions are equivalent to the distribution transmitted through them as the consequence of the existence of other 
(direct and indirect) light sources. <a href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/mkillum.pdf">Mkillum</a> 
is the program that allows creating illum surfaces in a convenient way <a href="http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/">(Ward & Shakespeare, 1998).
</a>For example, the daylight distribution transmitted through a window, which can be considered a consequence of the existence of the sun and sky, 
can be summarized into an illum surface.</i></blockquote>

<p align="justify">Illum surfaces may be very useful when rendering and modeling luminaires in detail. Personally, I am not
good at either of those, but I thought it was useful to include this feature in Groundhog.</p>

<p align="justify">Strictly speaking, these surfaces are not yet illum surfaces. They are exported without any Radiance modifier 
("void"), so they are invisible, and are supposed to be used for creating illums by running mkIllum program in order to create 
the actual illum.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>NOTE:</b> Every time the "Make Window" tool is used, an illum surface is created at the
interior side of the wall, represented in a semi-transparent green.</p>


<h3>Unlabeled surfaces</h3>
<p align="justify">The rest of the surfaces are the not-labeled surfaces of the scene. They will be
exported in radiance geometry files separated by layers.</p></div></div>
