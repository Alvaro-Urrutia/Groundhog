#Making windows in Groundhog

The whole idea here is to make a window that Groundhog actually identifies as a window. This, as explained in
the [Getting Started](file.GettingStarted.html) section, will be important when exporting the model to Radiance.

For doing this, you have to select the surface (or multiple surfaces) and right-click on it. Then, you must
choose "Label as Window" option in the context menu. After doing that the color will change to a semi-transparent
blue, but remember you can assign different materials to it. You should take care of the normal of the surface you
transform. This affects the Three and Five phase method implementations.


##Window groups
When performing annual daylighting simulations, it might be very useful and efficient to
group windows and treat them as if they were only one. This is a feature that was planned from the beginning
of Groundhog development and is now a reality.

This can be easily done by right-clicking two or more selected windows. Groundhog will ask
for a name for the group (i.e. 'Kitchen south-facing windows' or 'First floor east windows'), which will be
lately used for naming the files when exporting in "Groundhog distribution". Windows without groups will be exported
in files using their names (assigned by right-click --> assign name). It a window does not have a group or a name,
it will be exported by assigning a generic name. This is not recommended, since it is difficult to recognize
different windows by the content of the .rad file.

There is a button in the Groundhog Toolbar that allows seeing the groups. This button assigns
random colors to each group, and is deactivated like any other tool (i.e. by pressing the space-bar). When deactivated,
everything goes back to normal and the previous materials are assigned.
