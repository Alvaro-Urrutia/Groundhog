<h1>Making windows in Groundhog</h1>

<p align="justify">The whole idea here is to make a window that Groundhog actually identifies as a window. This, as explained in 
the <a href="file.GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> section, will be important when exporting the model to Radiance.</p>

<p align="justify">There are two ways of creating windows:</p>


<h2>Using the "make window" tool</h2>

<p align="justify">The make window tool is in the Groundhog Toolbar (for now, we do not have icons there, 
but if you put your mouse over them, a message with what they do will appear). It allows making a window through
a thick wall. This is a characteristic that we wanted to add to Groundhog from the beginning.</p>


<p align="justify">It is important to notice that this tool creates a window on the exterior side (which you can move to the
interior, if you want) and an illum surface on the inside (shown in semi-transparent green). If you do not want the illum 
surface to exist, you can delete it. <b>All windows have to be drawn from the exterior side of the wall.</b></p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand, this tool can be used for generating multiple windows at once, by selecting multiple
polygons at once.</p>


<p align="justify">So, using it is very simple, you just have to:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Draw a wall that have some thickness.</h3>

</figure>

<h3>Step 2: Draw a shape that will represents the window.</h3>
<p align="justify">This shape has to point outside (i.e. front of the surface pointing out of the wall, 
as shown in Figure 2). In case is not like that, you can right-click on it, and reverse it.</p>

</figure>

<h3>Step 3: Select the shape (it does not matter if you select a line).</h3>

<h3>Step 4: Press the "make window" button on the Toolbar.</h3>

</figure>

<h3>Step 5: Press the spacebar to quit the tool.</h3>
<p align="justify">This should be done automatically... soon.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<li align="justify">Windows are created a little bit inside the wall. This allows moving them, and you will not
be forced to put the windows on the outer side of the facade.</li>
<li align="justify">This tool will try to mercilessly go though the wall. Take care of windows too close
to wall borders, they can cause trouble.</li>


<h2>Labeling an existing surface as a window</h2>
<p align="justify">This might be useful for many situations. For example, designing a greenhouse, a curtain wall,
or some other structure with extremely thin walls.</p>
<p align="justify">In this case we can select the surface (or multiple surfaces) and right-click on it. Then, we must
choose "Transform into Window". After doing that the color will change to a semi-transparent blue, but remember you 
can assign different materials to it. You should take care of the normal of the surface you transform. This affects
the Three and Five phase method implementations.</p>
<p align="justify">This way of creating windows does not generate any illum surfaces.</p>

<h2>Window groups</h2>
<p align="justify">When performing annual daylighting simulations, it might be very useful and efficient to
group windows and treat them as if they were only one. This is a feature that was planned from the beginning 
of Groundhog development and is now a reality.</p>

<p align="justify">This can be easily done by right-clicking two or more selected windows. Groundhog will ask
for a name for the group (i.e. 'Kitchen south-facing windows' or 'First floor east windows'), which will be 
lately used for naming the files when exporting in "Groundhog distribution". Windows without groups will be exported
in files using their names (assigned by right-click --> assign name). It a window does not have a group or a name, 
it will be exported by assigning a generic name. This is not recommended, since it is difficult to recognize 
different windows by the content of the .rad file.</p>

<p align="justify">There is a button in the Groundhog Toolbar that allows seeing the groups. This button assigns
random colors to each group, and is deactivated like any other tool (i.e. by pressing the space-bar). When deactivated, 
everything goes back to normal and the previous materials are assigned.</p>
