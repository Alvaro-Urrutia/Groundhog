#Exporting and saving views in Groundhog

When rendering or performing simulations, it is useful to save views from a certain model.
Although the features that I will present now are not fully functional (I think I need to understand better 
how SketchUp and Radiance model cameras), it works for "normal" field of views.

SketchUp allows saving 'scenes' (called '<a href="http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/page.php">pages</a>' 
within the API). These scenes can be easily added to the model, and they store a camera that has a certain
view point, view direction and a field of view. It also allows having a perspective view and a parallel view.

Although Radiance has more 'camera' options than SketchUp (panoramic, hemispherical, etc), 
these two options are still very valuable, and can be exported from SketchUp to Radiance. The file with
the view will be saved in the 'Views' directory, with the name of the scene in SketchUp. Also, along with all the 
saved views, the 'current views' will be saved as 'view.vf'.



##Saving a view, and exporting it

###Step 1: Open the 'Scenes' menu
This is done on the 'Window' --> 'Scenes' menu.

<img src="Views/fig1.png">
<figcaption>Figure 1: First step - Open the 'Scenes' menu.</figcaption>
</figure>

###Step 2: Save a Scene
This is done in the 'Scenes' menu.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Views/fig2.png">
<figcaption>Figure 2: Second step - Save a Scene.</figcaption>
</figure>

###Step 3: Put a name to the Scene
This is also done in the 'Scenes' menu.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Views/fig3.png">
<figcaption>Figure 3: Third step - Put a name to the Scene.</figcaption>
</figure>

###Step 4: Export and look for it on the Views directory
It should be saved on the Views directory, along with the actual view file
and the other Scenes. The blank spaces are replaced by an underscore.
