Please contact us to gmolina1@uc.cl

# Programing tasks
- Allow project overwrite. That is, modify the model, press “export” again and replace the existing project with the actual one. Much more comfortable for working with Radiance and SketchUp simultaneously.
- Allow non-horizontal workplanes
- Fix the "view" exporter. It is not exporting properly... I think I need to understand better how to model a camera.
- Importing models from Revit® or other CAD programs. 
- Allow importing furniture, materials, fenestration systems and luminaries from a (online maybe?) library.

# Non-programming tasks
- Maybe "solve" some of the Radiance tutorials using Groundhog...?
- Logo (please?)... the name comes from the Groundhog Day tradition, just in case you want to create it.
- Icons for tools (please...?)
- TUTORIAL: Groups and Components.
- TUTORIAL: Tutorial 0.
- TUTORIAL: Including models from the 3D warehouse
- TUTORIAL: Adding terrain from Google Earth
- Any documentation you would like to fix or add.
