<h1>Including illum surfaces in Groundhog</h1>


<h2>Including illum surfaces in Groundhog</h2>

<p align="justify">As was mentioned in the <a href="file.GettingStarted.hml">Getting Started</a> 
section, illum surfaces are useful for rendering and modeling luminaires. Even though they are not
an easy-to-understand concept, Greg Ward helped me define illum surfaces as:</p>

<blockquote align="justify"><i>Illum surfaces, also known as "impostors" or "proxies," are light-emitting surfaces whose luminous 
distributions are equivalent to the distribution transmitted through them as the consequence of the existence of other 
(direct and indirect) light sources. <a href="http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/mkillum.pdf">Mkillum</a> 
is the program that allows creating illum surfaces in a convenient way <a href="http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/">(Ward & Shakespeare, 1998)
</a>. For example, the daylight distribution transmitted through a window, which can be considered a consequence of the existence of the sun and sky, 
can be summarized into an illum surface.</i></blockquote>

<p align="justify">Although I have not used illum surfaces too much, I understand this might be a useful feature 
for some people.</p>

<p align="justify">It is important to notice that every time we make a window opening in Radiance, an
illum surface is created on the interior side of the wall. However, there might be times when we want to create
others. The only way of doing this is to Label a surface as an illum.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Build a model where you need an illum.</h3>
<p align="justify">It can be a space with a skylight, like the model shown in Figure 1.</p>

</figure>

<h3>Step 2: Draw a surface where you want the illum</h3>
<p align="justify">You can take advantage of SketchUp tools for that.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Right-click it and label it as an illum surface</h3>

</figure>

<h3>Step 4: See it transformed</h3>
<p align="justify">Although illum surfaces in SketchUp have a material, they are exported in Radiance format without
any modifier ("void"). The semi-transparent green material is a way of recognizing it.</p>
