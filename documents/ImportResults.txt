#Importing results for data visualization

# THIS SECTION IS NOT UP TO DATE.

After exporting a model and performing a simulation or calculation, it is often
very important to see the results you generated (i.e. Daylight factor, illuminance,
or other) within the model, so you and people who are going to see your analysis
can visualize the spacial lighting distribution. This can lead to diagnostics
and enhancement of the design.


##Import results

###Step 1: Include workplanes in the model
See that specific tutorial. It is easy.

###Step 2: Export the model and perform some calculations

The file that contains the results needs to be a single-column list of values.
The first line may be the name of a file (full path) that describe the shape of
each result pixel (when imported, each value will be represented by a triangle
with a color). There must be one triangle for each pixel. In case that there is
no file, a file with the same name will be looked for in the ../Workplanes
directory, but with the extension .pxl. That is, if we intend to import a file
that is called 'MyResults.pts', it either needs to have the full path to its
corresponding pixel file on the first line, or the latter needs to be located
in the relative '../Workplanes/MyResults.pxl'.

All kind of results may be obtained with RTRACE and RCONTRIB programs, and the format may be arranged by using RCALC.

An example, getting the Lux of a certain scene:


```
rtrace -h -oov [options] octree < Workplanes/Grid.pts | rcalc -e '$1=179*(0.265*$4+0.67*$5+0.065*$6)' > Results.txt
```

###Step 3: Import results
Go to the menu Plugins (Extensions)--> Groundhog --> Import Results, and look for the file you want to import.


###Step 4: Analyse results

Groundhog allows importing results from multiple workplanes in the same model, so an entire space can be analyzed easily. However,
the only way of comparing results from different workplanes is to have one single scale for the entire model.

Accordingly, every time a set of results is imported, the scale is reset in order to cover from
the minimum result value to the maximum. That means that when you import a second workplane, the colors
of the first one will probably change.

However, in some cases, it might be useful to choose your own scale.
This can be done by going to Plugins –> Groundhog –> Results –> Scale handler.
