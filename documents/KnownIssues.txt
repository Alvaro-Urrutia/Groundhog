#Known issues

##Exporting problems
- Copying and pasting windows, walls, workplanes or any surface with a name will end in repeated names... that causes errors when exporting.

##Simulation problems
- Radiance multithreading does not seem to be working on OSX. I think that is a problem of compatibility between Radiance and OSX
- Radiance multithreading is not supported on Windows

##Creating materials problems
- Issues may be found when inputing an incomplete numbers on forms. That is, ".7" instead of "0.7".
