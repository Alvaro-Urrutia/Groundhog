#Known issues

##Exporting problems
- Copying and pasting windows, walls, workplanes or any surface with a name will end in repeated names... that causes errors when exporting.
- TILT field in IES files (for exporting luminaires) does not work.


##Simulation problems
- Radiance multithreading does not seem to be working on OSX Yosemite. That is a problem of compatibility between Radiance and OSX, and has nothing to do with Groundhog.
- Radiance multithreading is not supported on Windows
- The Daylight Factor algorithm adds the contribution of Artificial Lighting.... thus, do not use it if you have luminaires.
- Some windows users have had trouble assigning the Radiance path. I have been told that was solved as follows:
    1. Go to 'Control Panel' > 'System' > 'Advanced' > 'Environmental Variables' and check if the Radiance PATH is correct. If not, fix it.
    2. Then input the PATH in the Groundhog Preferences menu as follows: **C:/Program Files (x86)/Radiance/bin**, that is, with "/" (not "\") and without adding any program name.

##Creating materials problems
