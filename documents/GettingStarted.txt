#Understanding Groundhog
The following sections reference some [Radiance](http://www.radiance-online.org)
programs and conceptual elements. It is assumed that you have some (not really advanced) knowledge about those topics.

Groundhog intends to use as much as possible the main SketchUp features.
This allows using other SketchUp geometry-generating-plugins and still be able to export to
Radiance. You can even download models from the 3D Warehouse (some complex models will include "non planar" faces...
in my experience, I just erase them, and the model is usually not affected).

Internally, Groundhog only analyzes SketchUp surfaces ([faces](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/face.php)),
and [Groups](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/group#definition) and [Components](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/componentdefinition),
and only exports Radiance polygons (which will not only be triangles, but more complex
polygons as well). Groundhog always exports in one distribution (i.e. set of files and folders)
making a difference between Windows, Workplanes, Illums and other kinds of surfaces. This distribution
is the one I use, and keeping it constant helps creating scripts for accelerating Daylight analysis,
and avoiding errors.

The following section explains what are and how Groundhog identifies different kinds of
surfaces in the scene, and how the two different exporting options deal with such components.

##Different kinds of surfaces: Labels
As was explained earlier, Groundhog will only export SketchUp's faces (including those within components and groups).
Such faces may be of different classes, such as illum, window, workplane and "the rest".

In order to be light, fast and easy to use, Groundhog "Labels" the different polygons in the
scene by using SketchUp's [set_attribute](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/entity.php#set_attribute)
and [get_attribute](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/ourdoc/entity.php#get_attribute)
 API methods. This allows the user to delete, move, create and split workplanes, illums and windows with the tools provided by SketchUp.
For example, if a workplane has been defined within the model, dividing it (by drawing a line within it) or copying and pasting it
will result in the existence of two workplanes. In the same way, deleting it will make the workplane disappear without the need
of going through complex internal data structures.
