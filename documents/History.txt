# Groundhog 0.6

- Exporting distributions were unified into a unique one that places illums of each layer in a separate file and window groups in other files.
- Groups are now exported as if they were components.
- SketchUp 2015 is now considered the required SketchUp version
- Added a RIF file exporter to simplify rendering.

# Groundhog 0.5

- The “show/hide” tools were moved from the Groundhog Toolbar to the View menu.
- The “Show Window Groups” tool was algo moved to the View Menu.
- It is now possible to export a model without saving it as well as saving it in a different directory.
- The “Add Workplane” tool was downgraded to a simple script. It is more comfortable since the user no longer has to write down the height of the Worplane. The Workplanes may be moved just as any other face.
- Added the “Label as workplane” Context Menu. The faces have to be horizontal.
- Window Groups and Workplanes require a name. This name will be used for exporting them.
- Components may now be exported. Even Nested components (components within components) seem to be working OK. Groups are trickier.



# Groundhog 0.4

- Groundhog seem to be working O.K. on SketchUp 2014
- Materials can be supported by *.mat file stored on a directory... if not, they are guessed.
- Exporting groups and one-level components is supported (components within components do not really work... needed?)
- Wrapped "Make Window" and "Add Workplane" operations into one "Undo"... better and more comfortable.


# Groundhog 0.3

- Materials started to be supported, as well as SketchUp Components (non of them is ready yet).
- Although windows can still be grouped, the groups can´t be seen, since "materials" (i.e. colors) mean something now. We need to solve this.
- The project was completely reorganized, introducing classes… Then, it was published.

# Groundhog 0.2

- Change of paradigm. Groundhog intends to export well, for now. In the future we might simulate within SketchUp.
- Grouping of windows option was added, as well as showing them in different colors.
- "Winfo" and "SimFile" files do not exist any more. 
- Groundhog is now an extension, that can be turned on or off inside SketchUp.

# Groundhog 0.1

- Project started as part of Germán Molina´s MSc. thesis, under the advice of Sergio Vera 
Ph.D and Waldo Bustamante, Ph.D, at the school of Engineering of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.
- Exports into Radiance and 3phase method formats.
- Calculations have to be done from a "Window Information File" and a "Simulation File", using perl scripts outside SketchUp.
- Materials are not supported at all. The program exports a list of assigned modifiers, and they have to be filled by the user.
- Sensor location is done over the workplane... the location is shown by drawing two lines forming an X.
- Sensor location involves ray-casting... which is very inefficient. 
- Materials are treated separated from CFS.
- Grouping windows was not yet supported.
