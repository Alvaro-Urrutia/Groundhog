<h1>Exporting Groups and Components</h1>


<h2>About groups and components</h2>

<p align="justify">Groundhog treats Groups and Components just as SketchUp does... that is, each group and component
will be exported in its own file, with its own materials, and then 'xformed' into another file in order to position it
somewhere... there are sutil diferences, though, and they are explain below.</p>

<p align="justify">A Group is, well, a group of elements that are tied together. You can group, for example, 
a set of luminaires or furniture. Then, you can copy and paste the whole group, move it around, delete it, etc. </p>

<p align="justify">Components, on the other hand, can be thought as groups that are meant to be repeated
a number of times and that will always be equal. For example, an office may have 15 chairs, and they will
all be the same. In this case, it makes little sense to export the same chair 15 times. On the contrary, 
it is better to export it just once and then tell Radiance that we are including that chair in different 
locations and orientations within the Office. Accordingly, Components will be exported just once in an exlusive
file and then included into the main 'scene.rad' or another group or component file by using the Radiance's '!xform' 
command.</p>

<p align="justify">Nested components  or groups (components or groups that lay within another component) will be 
“!xformed” inside the definition of the parent component (i.e. within the .rad file located in the corresponding 
directory). First level components (components that are not inside any other component), on the other hand, will 
be “!xformed” in the scene file. Play a little with this.</p>

<h2>How to use this little difference</h2>
<p align="justify">Replacing 10 equivalent groups by one component can save space time and space. Space since the 
'xform' command used to place it in other files is much smaller than re-writing the same object again and again. And
time since any modification made on the component file will be repeated in all of its instances, thus saving us modelling time.</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>
<p align="justify">Windows, Illums and Workplanes that are placed within components or groups are totally ignored when exporting.</p>
