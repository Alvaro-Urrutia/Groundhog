# Groundhog List of Values

Some surfaces in the models will actually contain values that may be useless for SketchUp but that may be
very useful for Radiance. 

Different kinds of entities will have different kinds of values, as is specified later.

The way of retrieving a value is the following:

```
value=GH_Labeler.get_value(entity)
```

## Result Pixel value

Every pixel, generated when Radiance results are imported back to SketchUp, contains its 
value within it. This allow updating the scale (which will require modifying the color of the pixel)
and retrieving the value of a certain pixel for numeric analysis.

The value of a pixel is a Float.

```
value=GH_Labeler.get_value(entity) # 'value' is a float
```


## Solved Workplane value

A Solved Workplane is a group of Result Pixels, each of which has its own numeric value stored. The value
of the Solved Workplane will be a 2-component array of floats that represent the minimum and
maximum value of all the Result Pixels within it. This value is used for updating the scale of 
the results being shown.

The value of a Solved Workplane is an array of floats with 2 components.

```
value=GH_Labeler.get_value(entity) # 'value' is an array
min_value=value[0]
max_value=value[1]
```
