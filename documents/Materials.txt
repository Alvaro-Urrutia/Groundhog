# How Groundhog deals with materials


Materials are a very delicate thing in lighting simulation. A model with incorrectly defined materials
may return beautiful images and data to make nice plots, although it will all be incorrect 
([GIGO rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out)). According to this, Groundhog
allows you to create Radiance materials using a Wizard, where you input the required values (i.e. "local materials") 
for your model to be physically correct. In such cases, Groundhog will export the faces with the materials
you defined. 

In case you just do not care about accuracy, you can just use SketchUp as usual, and let Groundhog figure out how the
materials that your Radiance model must have in order to look like the SketchUp one. These materials, however, will
always be perfectly diffuse plastics and glass.

The proces of exporting materials is the following (done for each face):

1. Groundhog checks if the surface has a front material. In case of not having one, 
it will use the back material. In case it does not have a back material either, default materials will be assigned 
(a gray Lambertian material for opaque surfaces, and a clear glass for windows).
2. After finding the SketchUp material, Groundhog will check if the material "is local" (i.e. was input by the user 
as a Radiance material.
3. If the SketchUp material is local, it will be assigned to the surface in the Radiance model.
4. If the SketchUp material was not local, then the material will be guessed.

Some important things may be concluded from above. First, **front-material has preference over back-material** on
every surface. That is, if a surface has two materials, the front one will be used in the Radiance model. Second, 
**if the surface has no material, a perfectly diffuse gray material will be assigned**.
