<h1>Including workplanes into the model</h1>
<p align="justify">Including workplanes into the model will be useful for obtaining numerical (quantitative) results such as
annual simulations, daylight factors and other results.</p>

<p align="justify">Workplanes will be shown as a semi-transparent red surface, although this surface is labeled as 
"Workplane", and will not be exported to the Radiance model as a surface. Actually, at the moment of exporting, you will 
be asked for the spacing of the workplane sensors.</p>

<p align="justify">Workplanes need to be horizontal and rectangular surfaces with no holes.</p>



<p align="justify">Workplanes are supposed to be horizontal. We are planning on allowing non-horizontal ones soon.</p>

<h2>Including a workplane</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Draw a surface that you want to be a Workplane</h3>
<p align="justify">This surface has to be rectangular, horizontal and cannot have any holes</p>


<h3>Step 2: Right click the surface.</h3>
<p align="justify">When right clicking, look for "Label as workplane" in the Context menu, and click it.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Write the name of the workplace</h3>
<p align="justify">The idea is to give it a reasonable name as “Office desk” or “hallway”. This name will be used when exporting sensors.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Move it to choose the final location</h3>
<p align="justify">The workplace can be moved and modified. You should notice that rotating it might end in errors.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Choose the spacing of the sensors</h3>
<p align="justify">This will be done at the moment of exporting the model.</p>

<h2>Location of the sensors</h2>
<p align="justify">SOON.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p align="justify">More than one surface can be labeled as Workplane at the same time. The assigned name will be "Name_1", "Name_2, etc
 where 'Name' corresponds to what the user introduced as the name</p>
