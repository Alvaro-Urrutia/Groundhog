#Including workplanes into the model
Including workplanes into the model will be useful for obtaining numerical (quantitative) results such as
annual simulations, daylight factors and other results.

Workplanes will be shown as a semi-transparent red surface, although this surface is labeled as 
"Workplane", and will not be exported to the Radiance model as a surface. Actually, at the moment of exporting, you will 
be asked for the spacing of the workplane sensors.

Workplanes need to be horizontal and rectangular surfaces with no holes.



Workplanes are supposed to be horizontal. We are planning on allowing non-horizontal ones soon.

##Including a workplane

###Step 1: Draw a surface that you want to be a Workplane
This surface has to be rectangular, horizontal and cannot have any holes

###Step 2: Right click the surface.
When right clicking, look for "Label as workplane" in the Context menu, and click it.


###Step 3: Write the name of the workplace
The idea is to give it a reasonable name as “Office desk” or “hallway”. This name will be used when exporting sensors.

###Step 4: Move it to choose the final location
The workplace can be moved and modified. You should notice that rotating it might end in errors.

###Step 5: Choose the spacing of the sensors
This will be done at the moment of exporting the model.


###Notes
* More than one surface can be labeled as Workplane at the same time. The assigned name will be "Name_1", "Name_2, etc
 where 'Name' corresponds to what the user introduced as the name

## Final location of the sensors
There are a couple of things to know of where will the sensors finally be.
	
* The sensor spacing you define when exporting will be slightly modified in order to allow an exact division of the workplane and allow a uniform distribution
* The previous point is done in both directions of the workplane, so the spacing in both direction will be similar, but not exactly the same
* Margins are left in the border of the workplane. These margin correspond to one half of the spacing on each direction. This allow drawing the results correctly when importing results
