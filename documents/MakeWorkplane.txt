<h1>Including workplanes into the model</h1>
<p align="justify">Including workplanes into the model will be useful for obtaining numerical (quantitative) results such as
annual simulations, daylight factors and other results.</p>

<p align="justify">Workplanes will be shown as a semi-transparent red surface, although this surface is labeled as 
"Workplane", and will not be exported to the Radiance model as a surface. Actually, at the moment of exporting, you will 
be asked for the spacing of the workplane sensors.</p>

<p align="justify">Workplanes are supposed to be horizontal. We are planning on allowing non-horizontal ones soon.</p>

<h2>Including a workplane</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Draw a surface over which you want to put a workplane.</h3>
<p align="justify">This surface has to point down. I know is not the best or more intuitive, I wish this ged fixed soon.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Select the surface.</h3>

<h3>Step 3: Press the 'Add Workplane' tool.</h3>

<h3>Step 4: Write the name of the workplace</h3>
<p align="justify">The idea is to give it a reasonable name as “Office desk” or “hallway”. This name will be used when exporting sensors.</p>

</figure>

<h3>Step 5: Press the spacebar to quit the tool.</h3>
<p align="justify">This should be done automatically... soon.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Move it to choose the final location</h3>
<p align="justify">The workplace can be moved and modified. You should notice that rotating it might end in errors.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p align="justify">When a workplane is created inside a room, it usually splits the walls into two surfaces. 
This is not convenient. I have managed to deal with this by "offsetting" the floor, so the final workplane
is separated from the walls.</p>
